# MLProject3D
A project based on Implementing Machine Learning to replicate poses from an image into a 3D model

The main goal of our research was to utilize Machine Learning to process the pose of a human (given an image) 
and to then replicate onto a 3D model utilizing Blender and Python. 
Read Proposal.docx for further detail of the objective and method.

This project is unachievable due to the limitations of Haar Cascades.
This method could be improved upon using Convolution Neural Networks.
