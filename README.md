# MLProject3D
A project based on Implementing Machine Learning to replicate poses from an image into a 3D model

The main goal of our research was to utilize Machine Learning to process the pose of a human (given an image) 
and to then replicate onto a 3D model utilizing Blender and Python. 
Read Proposal.docx for further detail of the objective and method.

This project is unachievable with haar cascade, due to the level complexity
This method could be proved upon by using Convolution Neural Networks
